    # Pairwise permit to perform global or local alignement. For this script we choose to work using global alignements. In fact, we want to know if sequences are globally similar. Local alignements are mostly used to search for subsequences similar between to sequences.
    # So for this script we use global alignement. We need to configure function to perform alignement as wanted.
    # To do it we can give two coded parameters:
    #   - first parameter set up matches and mismatches.
    #   - second set up gaps
    # For this script we select a match score for identical chars else it is a mismatch score (m code) and same gap penalties for both sequences (s code too)
    # For score, we can add supplementary parameters.
    # Match score: 2
    # Mismatch score: -1
    # Opening Gap: -0.5
    # Extending Gap: -0.1
